Of course, the man is Stephen Falken. He invites you in and then proceeds to   tell you a story about dinosaurs and tries to convince you that nuclear war is  inevitable. All you want him to do is make a phone call to explain to NORAD whatis really happening; that it's just a computer simulation! When it appears that your attempts to convince Falken to help are futile, you decide to leave. You   look for a boat and in the absence of that Jennifer suggests you swim. You      decline, telling her that you never learned how to swim and that you thought    you'd always have plenty of time. Then you hear a chopper and the ground is lit up by search lights. You assume that Falken has turned you in, but then you     realise that it is Falken piloting the chopper. Falken calls you on the PA and  tells you to get in. You then proceed to fly to NORAD. You get to NORAD, but    barely make it in time, before they lock down the mountain and seal the blast   doors. At NORAD, Stephen Falken looks at the screens in the War Room, before    announcing to General Beringer that the missiles are phantoms; a fantasy, a     computer enhanced hallucination - and asks him to call it off. The General      agrees to ride out the attack, before launching the missiles.
