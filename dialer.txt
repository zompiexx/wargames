Congratulations, you have successfully completed a scan for computer systems inSunnyvale, California. Now, before you attempt to hack into any of the systems  you have found, it's time to take a break. You decide to go to the arcade and   play some Galaga - where you bump into Jennifer. Jennifer says she changed her  mind and does want you to change her grade after all (I did try and tell you).  Jennifer comes back to your house where your computer screen is on the DIALER   program. She asks what it's doing, to which you reply, it's 'dialling numbers'. Jennifer asks if it will take long as she is keen to get her grade changed      (maybe you already changed it?). Now check the scan results and try to connect  to the systems you have found.
