You panic, almost certain that the authorities are coming to get you! You      disconnect your phone, just in case the WOPR (Joshua) tries to call you again.  Then you venture out to the Mall. Whilst at the Mall, you spot a government car (you know the sort). You try to walk away, but they already have you in their   sights and arrest you. They take you to NORAD, where initially you are locked inthe infirmary, but later you are met by Mr. McKittrick - the computer facility  manager at NORAD. He takes you up to his office and questions you, but is calledaway - leaving you alone in his office. There is a terminal near you, flashing  cursor beckoning. You wonder if the "backdoor" still works - so give it a try!
