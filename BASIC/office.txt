Just as the address scrolls up on the screen, the office door is flung open -  and in rush NORAD Security. They inform you that you are going to be transportedto Denver, Colorado where you will be held in Federal custody pending charges ofespionage. You tell them that you need to speak to Mr. McKittrick and that WOPR (Joshua) is going to start a war, but they don't listen! They return you to the infirmary whilst they arrange your transport. You now know that WOPR (Joshua)   cannot tell the difference between a game and reality and will likely start     WWIII by launching a nuclear strike. You will do everything in your power to    prevent that from happening, but you don't have long. You rummage through the   drawers in the infirmary where you discover a voice recorder. You shout to the  guard and tell him you need the bathroom. He unlocks the door and as he does,   you record the tones from the door security keypad using the voice recorder.    When the coast is clear, you play the tones back from the voice recorder to     unlock the door. You see the lift coming, and left with limited options for yourescape, you climb into a ventilation hatch. This then leads you out under the   steps in  the war room. It is your good fortune that today they have a party of tourists, so you mix in with them and manage to escape from NORAD undetected...
